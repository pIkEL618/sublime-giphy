# Sublime Giphy

Did you ever want to add fancy gifs to some markdown, but also were feeling
_really_ lazy?

This handy function grabs random gifs from [giphy](https://giphy.com/) for a given set of keywords (selections) in Sublime Text 3 and replaces those selections with a markdown snippets.

### I am a TOTAL geek and want this, but for emacs
Checkout this repo: [emacs-giphy](https://github.com/chamook/emacs-giphy), that inspired me to do this one.
