# Sublime Giphy

Did you ever want to add fancy gifs to some markdown, but also were feeling
_really_ lazy?

This handy function grabs random gifs from [giphy](https://giphy.com/) for a given set of keywords (selections) in Sublime Text 3 and replaces those selections with a markdown snippets. 

To install this to your Sublime Text 3 installation running on Mac OS, put all files under /Users/xxxx/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User/
